# VTHacks11

VTHacks11 Project

Thoughts, what if we look into possibly creating it so that we map each of the bus stops and ask google maps the time it would take to go from each bus stop to the next bus stop. This could be fairly hardcoded. Does not need to be super elegant.

To Do List:

1. Create an alg to understand how long it will take to get to a bus stop based on its current location.
   a) use the current location and figure out duration it would take to travel based on time of day and google maps forecast
   b) use the time of day to match with school class schedule to help understand how busy buses will be and boarding/off-boarding times
   ^ this is the part that will make our alg more accurate

2. Establish link with RPI via WiFi and computer(ssh/ethernet)
3. Work on hardware integration for raspberry pi using the display and button
   a) Simple script to detect button press
   b) Basic script to display data to the lcd
   c) Make it pretty
   d) Integrate with the live data feed / heuristic alg
4. Marketing
   a) This whole idea hinges on some stellar marketing and understanding of just how big a problem this actually is for the VT students.b) Logo
   c) Elevator Pitch
   d) Video demo possibly <- this is mainly for the devpost
   e) Presentation

Extra features to add if time permits:
1. text message providing an update 5 min before
2. capacity of the bus
3.
